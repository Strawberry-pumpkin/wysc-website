        <p>Please fill in your full name, date of birth and your display name in the form below.</p>
        
        <p>Please note that the names as they appear on the WESPA ratings list happen to be limited to 20 characters of length. If you already 
            have a WESPA rating, please enter the name exactly as it appears in the ratings list in that field. If you don't have a
            <a href="https://wespa.org/ratings.shtml" target="_blank">WESPA rating</a>,
            we strongly recommand that the display name should be your <strong>first and last name</strong>. In some cases such as De Silva or De Almeida the last name itself is made up of 
            two components so having three names entered into the display name field would be fine. If your first name and last name are longer than 20 characters
            please truncate it accordingly</p>

        
        <p>You only need to fill this form once. There after you can easily enroll in the WYSC, the WYSC side tournament or the Sri Lanka Internation Open.</p>
